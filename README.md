# Advanced Automation Systems Portfolio

This repository contains two sophisticated automation projects that demonstrate expertise in concurrent programming, security bypass techniques, and resilient network operations.

## Project Overview

### [Trading Bot System](./Trading%20Bot/)

A high-performance trading system built in Rust that monitors 10,000+ items across multiple e-commerce platforms simultaneously. Key features:

- **Concurrent session management** for monitoring multiple markets in real-time
- **Advanced security bypass techniques** to circumvent Cloudflare and other protection systems
- **Proxy rotation infrastructure** with per-market traffic patterns to avoid detection
- **Profitable trading algorithms** consistently generating 10% weekly profit

This system ran successfully on minimal hardware (8GB RAM VDS) while handling extensive data processing and network operations.

### [US Visa Appointment Bot](./US%20Visa%20Appointment%20Bot/)

A sophisticated monitoring system for automatically securing US visa appointments. Key features:

- **Thread-safe concurrent account management** handling 100+ simultaneous sessions
- **Browser automation with security bypass** to handle complex authentication flows
- **Error-resilient monitoring** with comprehensive recovery mechanisms
- **Specialized data extraction** for processing localized appointment information

This system successfully monitored and booked appointments through the heavily-protected US Visa website.

## Technical Highlights

Both projects showcase advanced programming techniques including:

- Sophisticated concurrent processing with thread synchronization
- Advanced network resilience with retry mechanisms and failover strategies
- Security countermeasures to bypass detection systems
- Robust error handling for 24/7 operation in adversarial environments

## Repository Structure

Each project is contained in its own folder with dedicated code samples and documentation. See the individual project READMEs for detailed technical information.
