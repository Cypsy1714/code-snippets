# US Visa Appointment Monitoring System

This project demonstrates a sophisticated system for monitoring and automatically booking US visa appointments. It showcases advanced programming techniques including concurrent session management, browser automation, security bypass methods, and robust error handling.

## Key Technical Features

### Advanced Concurrent Account Management

* **Thread-safe shared state** - Uses Rust's `Arc<RwLock<>>` pattern to safely share account data across threads
* **Lock-free async operations** - Carefully manages read/write lock scopes to avoid blocking during I/O operations
* **Batch processing strategy** - Implements a sophisticated account rotation system to distribute load and avoid detection
* **Concurrent session management** - Handles 100+ simultaneous active sessions with controlled parallelism

### Browser Automation with Security Bypass

* **Multi-method DOM interaction** - Implements multiple fallback techniques for handling difficult UI elements
* **Session cookie extraction** - Extracts and maintains valid session cookies for API authentication
* **Header spoofing** - Uses realistic browser headers to avoid bot detection
* **Proxy rotation** - Distributes requests across multiple proxies to prevent IP-based blocking

### Error Resilient Appointment Management

* **Comprehensive recovery mechanisms** - Implements multiple fallback strategies for session recovery
* **State persistence** - Maintains system state across failures
* **Auto-retry logic** - Automatically retries operations with exponential backoff
* **Session timeout handling** - Detects and recovers from expired sessions

### Specialized Date Parsing and Processing

* **Localized date handling** - Processes dates in Turkish and other languages
* **Calendar navigation** - Intelligent datepicker interaction
* **HTML parsing** - Extracts structured data from complex HTML documents
* **Data validation** - Ensures data integrity through comprehensive validation

## System Architecture

The system is built around a high-performance core that orchestrates concurrent operations, handles session management, and processes appointment data. It utilizes a sophisticated combination of browser automation and direct API interactions to monitor and book appointments, with robust error handling and recovery mechanisms throughout.

The architecture is designed to scale efficiently, allowing for monitoring of multiple appointment slots simultaneously while maintaining resilience against system failures and website security measures.
